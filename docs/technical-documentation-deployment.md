## Testing Procedures and Frameworks

The application does not currently have any dedicated testing procedures or frameworks.

## Security Considerations and Best Practices

**Input Validation:**

The application uses Zod for input validation. The `createSafeAction` function in `src/lib/create-safe-action.ts` validates the input data against a provided schema.

**Data Sanitization:**

The application relies on Prisma ORM to prevent SQL injection attacks.

**Access Control:**

The application uses Iron Session for authentication and authorization. The `auth` function in `src/lib/auth.ts` retrieves the user session data, which can be used to control access to resources.
