# Smart Scheduler Implementation Tasks

## Phase 1: User Preferences Setup

### Task Group 1: Work Schedule Settings
1. Create interface for user to set their:
   - Working hours (start and end time)
   - Lunch break time and duration
   - Regular break preferences
   - Focus session preferences (Pomodoro duration)
   - Short and long break durations

### Task Group 2: Context Management
1. Allow users to define different work contexts (e.g., office, home)
2. Enable setting weekly schedules for each context
3. Add ability to specify which days and hours are assigned to which contexts

## Phase 2: Task Enhancement

### Task Group 3: Task Creation Updates
1. Add fields for:
   - Estimated completion time
   - Task priority level
   - Context assignment
   - Focus mode requirement
2. Create an intuitive interface for entering these details
3. Add validation to ensure reasonable time estimates

### Task Group 4: Task Breakdown System
1. Develop logic to:
   - Split large tasks into smaller segments
   - Calculate number of focus sessions needed
   - Account for breaks between sessions
   - Handle remaining time that doesn't fit full sessions

## Phase 3: Smart Scheduling System

### Task Group 5: Core Scheduling Logic
1. Create system to:
   - Match tasks to appropriate context days
   - Respect working hours
   - Account for fixed breaks
   - Prioritize tasks effectively
   - Handle focus sessions appropriately

### Task Group 6: Schedule Generation
1. Implement automatic scheduling that:
   - Fills available time slots efficiently
   - Respects task priorities
   - Maintains appropriate spacing
   - Handles context switches
   - Accounts for break times

## Phase 4: Focus Session Management

### Task Group 7: Timer System
1. Create focus session timer that:
   - Tracks work periods
   - Manages break transitions
   - Handles session completion
   - Allows manual adjustments
   - Provides visual feedback

### Task Group 8: Progress Tracking
1. Implement system to track:
   - Completed focus sessions
   - Break adherence
   - Task completion status
   - Daily productivity metrics

## Phase 5: Calendar Integration

### Task Group 9: Calendar View
1. Create visual calendar that shows:
   - Scheduled tasks
   - Focus sessions
   - Break periods
   - Context indicators
   - Time remaining
   - Progress status

### Task Group 10: Schedule Management
1. Add ability to:
   - View daily/weekly schedules
   - Make manual adjustments
   - Handle scheduling conflicts
   - Reschedule tasks when needed
   - Account for unexpected changes

## Phase 6: Refinement and Polish

### Task Group 11: User Experience
1. Add features for:
   - Easy schedule adjustments
   - Quick task rescheduling
   - Visual progress indicators
   - Context switching notifications
   - Break time reminders

### Task Group 12: System Optimization
1. Implement:
   - Schedule recalculation triggers
   - Efficient updates handling
   - Performance optimizations
   - Error recovery
   - Edge case handling

## Testing and Validation

### Task Group 13: Testing Requirements
1. Test:
   - Schedule generation accuracy
   - Focus session timing
   - Break insertion logic
   - Priority handling
   - Context switching
   - Manual overrides
   - Error scenarios

### Task Group 14: User Validation
1. Verify:
   - Interface usability
   - Schedule effectiveness
   - Focus session usefulness
   - Break timing appropriateness
   - Overall system reliability

## Future Considerations

### Task Group 15: Enhancement Planning
1. Consider adding:
