# Project Page Improvements Plan

## Loading State Improvements

### Initial Page Load
- Add loading.tsx in projects/[id] directory using the LoadingSpinner component
- Show a fullscreen loading state during initial navigation

### Data Loading States
- Add loading states during data fetching operations
- Implement skeleton loading for project details while data loads
- Show loading indicators during item filtering and sorting

### Component-Level Loading
- Add loading states for individual operations (e.g., adding tasks)
- Implement optimistic updates where possible to improve perceived performance

## UI Improvements for Project Items Section

### Component Structure
- Break down the large page component into smaller, focused components:
  - ProjectHeader (title, description, stats)
  - ProjectStats (metrics cards)
  - ProjectProgress (progress bar)
  - ProjectItemsHeader (search, filters)
  - ProjectItemsList (grid of items)

### Visual Improvements
- Enhance grid layout responsiveness
- Add visual feedback during filtering/sorting operations
- Improve empty state design
- Consider adding transitions for state changes

### Performance Optimizations
- Implement pagination or infinite scroll for large item lists
- Optimize filtering and sorting operations
- Add debouncing for search input

## Implementation Steps

1. Create loading.tsx for initial page load
2. Break down page.tsx into smaller components
3. Implement skeleton loading states
4. Add loading indicators for user actions
5. Enhance UI responsiveness and feedback
6. Optimize performance for large datasets

## Success Metrics

- Improved perceived performance during loading
- Better maintainability through component separation
- Enhanced user feedback during operations
- Smoother transitions between states
